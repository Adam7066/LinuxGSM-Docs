## Valheim Tips:

Direct connect to Valheim server:

Valheim's in-game browser can be slow, as a workaround you can directly connect to a server in-game through the Join Game tab by pressing the Join IP button, or by adding a server to your steam server favorites. To access the steam server list, at the top left of the steam library window go View->Servers, and in the new window press "Add A Server". Use `./vhserver details` to list the current query port. The default port is 2457.

Long Server Names:

Valheim has been previously known to have problems with long server names and special characters, if you are having trouble connecting to a server try making its name shorter or remove special characters.
